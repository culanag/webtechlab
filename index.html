                        A government committed to making sound and just decisions, taking account the effectiveness and transparency and the best possible process for making and implementing decisions-a community with <em>Good Governance</em>. Our goal is to raise awareness of what good governance is all about and encourage the community of Barangay Fort Del Pilar to actively participate in making a better government for the people.

            <ul>
                <li>Rule of Law
                    <p>
                        Good governance requires fair legal frameworks that are enforced by an impartial regulatory body, for the full protection of the stakeholders. No one is above the law and due process should be observed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Brgy. Fort del Pilar, local rules like "Aso ko, tali ko" are created and enforced by the barangay officials. The barangay has a local team of enforcers to make sure that rules are properly observed. However, it has been observed that not all of its rules are being followed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Transparency
                    <p>
                        A good governing body does not hide any information from the populace. Things like future projects, expenses, policies, should be disclosed to the general public as much as possible to prevent distrust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The barangay provides all the necessary information that the populace needs. It is also freely available due to it being posted just in front of the barangay hall. The information includes fees and other expenses spent by the barangay, as well as projects and advocacy posters. A barangay meeting is also held whenever there are new projects in the barangay to let everyone be informed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Responsiveness
                    <p>
                        The barangay is quick to respond to the concerns of its citizens. As soon as an issue is raised, depending on its urgency, the barangay will send a person to address the issue, for example to patrol in case of a suspicious person.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Consensus Oriented
                    <p>
                        The barangay's projects and policies are created, fully disclosing the information to the populace by having them participate in meetings. The projects and policies are then approved with the general consensus of the populace.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Equity and Inclusiveness
                    <p>
                        Anyone is allowed to live in the barangay premises, fully observing inclusiveness. Despite being so, the barangay is relatively peaceful and its community's well-being is enhanced, maintained, and improved through the barangay's projects and policies.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Effectiveness and Efficiency
                    <p>
                        The barangay's projects are received by the populace favorably as they yield good results. Examples include dog vaccination projects to help dog owners. The barangay's resources are also well-utilized for improving the well-being of the community.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Accountability
                    <p>
                        The barangay is regarded as reliable in terms of accountability. They immediately stop ongoing projects that are 
                        failing and take responsibility when things go wrong.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Participation
                    <p>
                        The barangay encourages participation from the community. They even have a system to discloses information to its citizens. Participation is fully encouraged especially during meetings regarding new projects and policies. Everyone can pitch in their ideas and freedom of expression is tolerated.
