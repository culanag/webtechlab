                        A government committed to making sound and just decisions, taking account the effectiveness and transparency and the best possible process for making and implementing decisions-a community with <em>Good Governance</em>. Our goal is to raise awareness of what good governance is all about and encourage the community of Barangay Fort Del Pilar to actively participate in making a better government for the people.

                            Good governance requires fair legal frameworks that are enforced by an impartial regulatory body, for the full protection of the stakeholders. No one is above the law and due process should be observed.
                            <br><br>
                            In Brgy. Fort del Pilar, local rules like "Aso ko, tali ko" are created and enforced by the barangay officials. The barangay has a local team of enforcers to make sure that rules are properly observed. However, it has been observed that not all of its rules are being followed.

                            A good governing body does not hide any information from the populace. Things like future projects, expenses, policies, should be disclosed to the general public as much as possible to prevent distrust.
                            <br><br>
                            The barangay provides all the necessary information that the populace needs. It is also freely available due to it being posted just in front of the barangay hall. The information includes fees and other expenses spent by the barangay, as well as projects and advocacy posters. A barangay meeting is also held whenever there are new projects in the barangay to let everyone be informed.

                            The barangay is quick to respond to the concerns of its citizens. As soon as an issue is raised, depending on its urgency, the barangay will send a person to address the issue, for example to patrol in case of a suspicious person.

                        The community can participate in meetings which the barangay hall holds frequently. The benefit of this meeting is not only to inform the citizens of new projects or rules to be proclaimed but also for the community to give their opinions. Everyone has the benefit to speak up and fairly get what they want through compromising. 
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        <em>What happens if we donâ€™t participate?</em> If we don't participate, we will be uninformed of new rules to be followed and we may break them thus being given a punishment. Also, we won't get to share our feelings whether we want what is happening or not. Simply go to the barangay hall when a meeting is being held.
