<h3> Advocacy </h3>
<p>No one should be discriminated upon regardless of physical capabilities and capacities. Person with disabilities must be exposed to social, educational, 
and physical conditions along with those who have none. When people with disabilities socialize with their peers who do not have disabilities, good things happen. 
The advocacy involves PWDS engaging in worthwhile activities with peers without disabilities. Once a month, the group conducts activities that will address the social, 
physical and educational needs by PWDS in the community. </p>
