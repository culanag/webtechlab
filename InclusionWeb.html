<h3> ADVOCACY </h3>
<a href="advo.html"><img id="cardimg1" class="cardimg" src="./img/gg.jpg" alt="Inclusion" ></a>
<article class="article">
<p>No one should be discriminated upon regardless of physical capabilities and capacities. 
Person with disabilities must be exposed to social, educational, and physical conditions along 
with those who have none. When people with disabilities socialize with their peers who do not have 
disabilities, good things happen. The advocacy involves PWDS engaging in worthwhile activities with 
peers without disabilities. Once a month, the group conducts activities that will address the social, 
physical and educational needs by PWDS in the community. </p>

<h4> HOW DO WE ADVOCATE THE INCLUSION IN BARANGAY FORT DEL PILAR? </h4>
<a href="how.html"><img id="cardimg1" class="cardimg" src="./img/gg.jpg" alt="Inclusion" ></a>
<article class="article">
<ul>
<li>Providing information about the benefits and privileges of PWDs - We want to provide information on how people without 
disabilities can help them. Educate people without disabilities that PWDs are also human and they deserve mutual respect.</li>
<li>Also with the help of local government, we hope that we can achieve inclusion in each community. Local government will provide 
services which are focused on PWDs and advocate local goverments to push or create ordinances that will benefit PWDs Activities. </li>
<li>Teach the community on how to communicate with them especially on mute or deaf PWDs. Teaching people on how to use sign language 
will surely benefit them by make a fun run for a cause or events that you can even join when it comes to earning money for 
PWD's for they can start their own business in a variety of stores. </li>
