      <p id="aw5p">We chose Barangay Fort Del Pilar to be our starting project because FDP is surrounded by animals and
        away from the city. We wanted to know if FDP is promoting the laws and policy being governed by our city
        even if it is located in the outskirts of the city. Upon interviewing several people in the barangay
        including kagawads, barangay officials, residents and commoners, we came to a conclusion that Barangay
        Fort Del Pilar is a place for both humans and animals. The animals's welfare in this part of the city is
        in good state. We want to be part of this project and help promote our advocacy and continue our fight
        against animal abuse.

      <p id="aw6p"> Last January 29, 2018 barangay Fort Del Pilar had their annual anti-rabies vaccination.
          Residents and their Pets went to designated locations in Fort Del Pilar to have free
          vaccinations for their pets.
      </p>
      <p id="aw7p">Upon interview, we gathered information that Barangay Fort Del Pilar conducts annual vaccinations for animals free 
		of charge and for every pet in the barangay. Just last January 29, alongside the staff of Baguio Veterinary Office, 
		the 2018 Anti-Rabbies Vaccination was held. This event was monitored by the barangay officials and the staff of the veterinary office. 
		This happened in the barangay hall's gate, basketball court and the barangay garden.
