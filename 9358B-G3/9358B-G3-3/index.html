          As a pet owner your pet should have a shelter, food, and water. You need to provide
          these for them to healthy. Next is hygiene of your pet It is your responsibility to
          bathe your pet if you have to, this will make them more comfortable. Having your pet

	  <img src="../9358B-G3-3/aw8.jpg" id=""alt="">
      <p id="aw5p">We chose Barangay Fort Del Pilar to be our starting project because FDP is surrounded by animals and
        away from the city. We wanted to know if FDP is promoting the laws and policy being governed by our city
        even if it is located in the outskirts of the city. Upon interviewing several people in the barangay
        including kagawads, barangay officials, residents and commoners, we came to a conclusion that Barangay
        Fort Del Pilar is a place for both humans and animals. The animals's welfare in this part of the city is
        in good state. We want to be part of this project and help promote our advocacy and continue our fight
        against animal abuse.
